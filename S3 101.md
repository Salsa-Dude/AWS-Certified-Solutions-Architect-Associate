# S3 

#### S3 
- provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

#### EBS
- An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to a single EC2 instance. You can use EBS volumes as primary storage for data that requires frequent updates, such as the system drive for an instance or storage for a database application.

#### So What is S3?

- S3 is a safe place to store your files
Stands for (Simple Storage Service)
- It is Object-based storage (is a general term that refers to the way in which we organize and work with units of storage, called objects. Every object contains three things:
Key (This is simply the name of the object)
Value (This is simply the data and is made up of sequence of bytes)
Version ID (Important for versioning)
Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
Subresources
- Access Control List
- Torrent

#### The basics of S3 are as follows

- S3 is Object-based (allows you to upload files)
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB
- Minimum file size that I can store on S3 is 0 Bytes 
- There is unlimited storage
- Files can be stored in Buckets (a folder to put your files)
- S3 is a universal namespace. (Buckets needs to be unique name)
- When you upload to S3, you will receive an HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful. 
- By default, customers can provision up to 100 buckets per AWS account
- Signed URLs and Signed Cookies are different ways to ensure that users attempting access to files in an S3 bucket can be authorised
- An Origin Access Identity on the other hand, is a virtual user identity that is used to give the CloudFront distribution permission to fetch a private object from an S3 bucket

#### How does data consistency work for S3?

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects (If you write a file a new file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view the data) 
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (If you update an existing file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version or you may not. Basically changes to objects can  take a little bit of time to propagate)
