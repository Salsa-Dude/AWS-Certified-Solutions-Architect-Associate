# S3 

#### S3 
- provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

#### EBS
- An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to a single EC2 instance. You can use EBS volumes as primary storage for data that requires frequent updates, such as the system drive for an instance or storage for a database application.

#### So What is S3?

- S3 is a safe place to store your files
Stands for (Simple Storage Service)
- It is Object-based storage (is a general term that refers to the way in which we organize and work with units of storage, called objects. Every object contains three things:
Key (This is simply the name of the object)
Value (This is simply the data and is made up of sequence of bytes)
Version ID (Important for versioning)
Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
Subresources
- Access Control List
- Torrent

#### The basics of S3 are as follows

- S3 is Object-based (allows you to upload files)
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB
- Minimum file size that I can store on S3 is 0 Bytes 
- There is unlimited storage
- Files can be stored in Buckets (a folder to put your files)
- S3 is a universal namespace. (Buckets needs to be unique name)
- When you upload to S3, you will receive an HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful. 
- By default, customers can provision up to 100 buckets per AWS account
- Signed URLs and Signed Cookies are different ways to ensure that users attempting access to files in an S3 bucket can be authorised
- An Origin Access Identity on the other hand, is a virtual user identity that is used to give the CloudFront distribution permission to fetch a private object from an S3 bucket

#### How does data consistency work for S3?

- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects (If you write a file a new file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view the data) 
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (If you update an existing file or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version or you may not. Basically changes to objects can  take a little bit of time to propagate)

#### S3 has the following features

- Tiered Storage Available

- Versioning
- Encryption
- MFA Delete
- Secure your data using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies

#### S3 Storage Classes

- S3 Standard 
  - 99.99% Availability 
99.99999999999% durability, stored in multiple devices in multiple facilities and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently. 
- S3 - IA
  - (Infrequently Accessed) 
For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than S3 but you are charged a retrieval fee.
- S3 One Zone - IA
  - For where you want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience.
99.5% Availability 


- S3 - Intelligent Tiering
  - Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact of operational overhead.
- S3 Glacier
  - Is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. Retrieval times configurable from minutes to hours.
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  - S3 Glacier Deep archive is Amazon S3’s lowest cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hours is acceptable.

#### You are charged for S3 in the following ways

- Storage
- Requests
- Storage Management Pricing
- Data Transfer Pricing
- Transfer Acceleration
- Cross Region Replication Pricing

#### Transfer Acceleration 
- enables fast, easy and secure transfers of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path. 

#### S3 notification feature 
- enables you to receive notification when certain events happen in your bucket. To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration identifying the events you want Amazon S3 to publish, and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the event notifications.

#### Cross-region replication
- is a bucket level configuration that enables automatic asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in different AWS regions. We refer to these buckets as source bucket and destination bucket. These buckets can be owned by different AWS accounts. The source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.

### Exam tips (S3)
- Remember that S3 is Object-based (allows you to upload files)
- Use Multi-part uploads for larger objects
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5 TB
- There is unlimited storage
- S3 automatically scales to high request rates.
- Files are stored in Buckets (buckets are folders)
- S3 is a universal namespace. That is names must be unique globally.
- Example of Link (https://s3.eu.west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru
- Not suitable to install an operating system on or host a database.
- A successful response to a PUT request for new object only occurs when the object is completely saved.
- You can turn On MFA Delete (protects object from getting accidently deleted)
- The Key fundamentals of S3 are
  - Key (This is simply the name of the object)
  - Value (This is simply the data and is made up of sequence of bytes)
  - VersionID (important for versioning)
  - Metadata (Data about data you are storing)
    - System metadata
      - Metadata such as object creation date is controlled where only S3 can modify the value. Other system metadata, usch as storage class configured and whether the object has server-side encryption enabled.
    - User-defined metadata
      - When uploading an object, you can also assign metadata to that object. You provide this optional information as a name-value pair when you send a PUT or POST request to create the object. WHen you upload objects using the REST API, the optional user-defined metadata names must begin with “x-amz-meta-” to distinguish them from other HTTP headers.
    - Subresources
      - Access Control Lists (The permissions of that object, you can lock each object down individually)
      - Torrent
- By default, Versioning is Disabled
- By default, Transfer Acceleration is suspended
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Object ( As soon as you create a new object, you’ll be able to read that object immediately.)
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)
- Know the storage classes
- Read the S3 FAQs before taking the exam. It comes up A LOT!
- Until 2018 there was a hard limit on S3 puts of 100 PUTs per second. To achieve this care needed to be taken with the structure of the name Key to ensure parallel processing. As of July 2018 the limit was raised to 3500 and the need for the Key design was basically eliminated. Disk IOPS is not the issue with the problem. The account limit is not the issue with the problem.
